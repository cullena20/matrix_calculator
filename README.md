# matrix_calculator
A matrix calculator in Python without the use of any modules. Built along with Jetbrain Academy. This program is able to perform various operations on matrices that users input. It can add matrices, multiply a matrix by a scalar, multiply matrices, perform various transpositions on a matrix, calculate a determinant, and find the inverse of a matrix. Although it would practically make more sense to use numpy to work with matrices, it was fun to build a matrix calculator in pure Python.
